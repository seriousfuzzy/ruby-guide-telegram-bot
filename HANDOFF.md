### Critical Monitoring
- **Response Time**: Should be < 3 seconds average
- **Error Rate**: Should be < 1% of requests  
- **Conversion Rate**: Target > 5% conversation to community join
- **User Completion**: Target > 80% complete conversation flow

## 💰 Operational Costs (Estimated)

### Monthly Costs (1000 active users)
- **Cloudflare Workers**: ~$5/month
- **Cloudflare D1**: ~$1/month  
- **OpenAI API**: ~$10-20/month
- **Total**: ~$16-26/month

### Scaling (10,000 active users)  
- **Cloudflare Workers**: ~$25/month
- **Cloudflare D1**: ~$5/month
- **OpenAI API**: ~$100-200/month
